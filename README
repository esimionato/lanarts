To build, make a directory called lanarts_build, and do:
cmake <path to lanarts folder>

eg, from lanarts:
cd ..
mkdir lanarts_build
cd lanarts_build
cmake ../lanarts

Copy the exe from 'lanarts_build/src' into the 'lanarts' folder and run it from there.

Go to folder where you want eclipse project files:
cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" <path to lanarts source>
