DEVELOPMENT:

The game is actively seeking new contributors! Shoot me an email at adam.domurad@gmail.com if interested and I'll happily help you get started.

COMPILING

The project uses CMake to create plaform independent build files. 

Other than CMake, freetype is the main dependency. If you are getting SDL errors when the game runs, try installing your SDL2 dev package (if on Linux).
Windows development requires running CMake on the lanarts source folder, and making sure the path to freetype is correct.

To build and run, do:
  ./run.sh
 from the lanarts source folder.

If developing on Windows, create the desired project files (eg by picking them from CMake GUI), build, and run the executable from the 'runtime' folder in source.
NOTE: Currently you will need to run compile_images.py before running. This is done automatically in run.sh but must be done separately during Windows development.

USING ECLIPSE:
For Linux/Mac. For Windows, you can use the CMake GUI. Go to folder where you want eclipse project files:
cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" <path to lanarts source>
