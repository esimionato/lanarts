Lanarts naming convention:

- All classes, enums, unions & structs should all start with a capital letter and be in CamelCase.
	examples: 
		class GameState { };
		struct SomeSimpleStruct { };
		enum Origin { LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT };

	Additional guidelines:
		- Type names should be as descriptive as possible, however 

- Variables, functions, methods & namespaces should all be written in all lower-case letters, and be separated by underscores.
  Member variables in a class should generally all be private, and begin with an underscore, especially if they have an associated getter.
  Member variables in a struct should generally all be public, and not begin with an underscore.
  Private methods do not need to start with an underscore.

	examples:
		int player_score = 0;
		struct MyPair {
			int first_number, second_number;
		};

		class MyPair {
		public:
			int first_number() const {
				return _first_number;
			}
			int second_number() const {
				return _second_number;
			}
		private:
			int _first_number, _second_number;
		}


- Constants and members of an enum should generally be written in all capitals, separated with underscores.
	examples:
		const int AI_SEARCH_TIMEOUT = 100;

- Typedefs of primitive types can be lowercase, if they simply represent a specific type of integer.
