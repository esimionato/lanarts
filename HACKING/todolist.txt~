Large:
- Versatile save format that allows for resuming a networked game 
- Add allied monsters that stay close to their 'owner' and shoot at nearby enemies
	Details:
	-May need two pathfinds per monster
	-More if we support double-sized enemies
	-Performance hit reasonable
- Improve room generation with more patterns & room connectivity tests
- Add tiered level generation with dungeons inline with overworld

Medium:
- Special case pushing for tight corridors ?
- Straight line AOE spell
- Lightning Spell that takes up multiple squares
- Add levels of minimap viewing
- Add doors (Doors somewhat done) and other dungeon features such as keys, destroyable blocks etc
- Fix so monsters dont swarm like hell around stairs (complex issue)

Small:
- Have a flexible portal system that indicates which level to connect to
- Add cooldowns to item use
- Ensure you do not spawn / use stairs and end up right on a monster
- Add controls overlay when certain button is pressed, so that the control scheme can be seen
- Add graphics for each class [DONEISH - Make multiple options]
- Make mouse jiggling not cause stair case movement
- Make damage amounts not show off screen
- Make enemies drop money/items
	- Would be best if enemies picked up items - but does lead to paranoid behaviour from player
		- Should probably not pick up any item the player has interacted with - but unrealistic
- Make all ranged enemies have a short range melee option for close kiters
- Fix arrows getting stuck in walls
- Fix monsters getting stuck in corridors -> give more room for RVO2 disabling
- Make Zin stronger!	
- Levels take too long to generate
	- Use BSP scheme
	- Don't crowd the level with too many room placements
- Monsters too weak as game progresses
	- give monsters abilities
	- spawn 'harder' versions of monsters
		- Dont let chickens & storm clouds spawn on level 9 - player is too strong
- Add items that give free XP but hurt you/ make you exhausted
	- Amount depends on dungeon depth
- You can only buy items by clicking on top 32x32 area
- Sometimes arrows show underneath blood
