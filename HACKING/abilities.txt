Abilities need to show on the action bar - these need to be both passive & active 

Maybe divide up the action bar as such:

Constant use | Buffs | Passive

Should passive abilities be defined as spells ?

This seems to be in the domain of effects.

Items & spells & effects might benefit from a merger.

Effects -> equipment without an equipment slot

lua components:
	Prereq func, Use func.


Extra stats:
- Ranged cooldown mult
- Spell cooldown mult
^ Essentially, stats need a attackmod function.
	^ Don't make the mistake of adding this to C++. Monsters don't need ranged/spell buffs.
	Do as much as possible in lua.
