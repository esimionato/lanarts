- Consider making a wxLua enabled lanarts toolset
	- Encourages contributions from non-technical people!!

	- Centered around updating YAML files visually
	- This could include setting up encounters, viewing/editting monster stats (Yaml emitting?? or probably straight yaml editing??) 
		- Builtin script editor would be nice, would need to have easy way to link monster to scripts
			- Probably embedded lua in YAML with block literals / implicit arguments
			- Also support linking to lua function from .lua, in which case string is simply editted
			- Support running the string through various dynamic sanity checks
	- Use of the lanarts lua api directly, eg use ldraw for drawing all sprites
	- Level/Vault editor -- needs better level generation support
	- Encounter instrumentation -- set up encounter and test it
		- Make sure they are fun & feasible at different levels
