- Make skill trees with evasion based abilities
- Spells on same skill tree 
- Have specialized dungeon rooms
- Dashing / pushing / teleporting as exclusive techs?
	- What will druid-likes use ? 
	(Dashing -> tied to dexterous skills, 
	teleporting -> tied to translocation skills,
	pushing -> tied to brute skills)
- Berserk tech tree -> honestly it progresses pretty naturally ...
	-> make it tied to severe spellcasting penalties
