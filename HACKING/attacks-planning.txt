- Need easy way to express attack areas
- A basic AOE spell for mage -> projectile with small AOE on hit
- Look into integrating simple lua bindings template library

What should this look like ?   

- Worry less about C++ exposure ... this should never be called from C++
- Worry less about calling lots of lua ... these are attacks, they only occur in the player's vicinity.
- Worry less about garbage ... although having a garbage-free strategy early can be beneficial
- More lua bindings

- Possibly describe projectiles as something ... more generic
	- Expose enough lua bindings to fully recode existing projectiles
	- Have 'step' function that in turns calls 'on_hit'
	- Have 'draw' function
... Questions remain:
	- What to do about item bindings ?
	- How to do item descriptions ?
		- Projectile item descriptions could easily be coded in lua
		- 

Fight abilities needed:
- Cleave
- Charge in direction (think chargepunch)
Archer abilities needed:
-
