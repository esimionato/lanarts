- Have to make attacks more satisfying
- Can't allow for simply walking by enemies and hitting, seems buggy
Ideas:
	- Make all melee attacks a charge forward & back ?
		- Gives up control to complete the attack
	- Enemies could do same
		- Enemy swarms would stop nearby, charge you
			- Possibly from far away
		- Probably good idea to code these kinds of enemies first, before making default for enemies/player
	- Spells will require a momentary 'cast' where you are stationary?
		- Neglible for weak spells
		- Can be eliminated with enough spell skill
Attacking should be fun at a fundamental level.
	- Again - details in lua ?
