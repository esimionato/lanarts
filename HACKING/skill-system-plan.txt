scrap this ...

fighting: <- provides HP, generic fighting improvements
	- defence 
	- melee
	- ranged
spellcasting: <- provides MP, generic spellcasting improvements
	- enchantment
	- conjurations
elementalism: <- provides generic element resistance
	- fire
	- ice
religion: <- improves god abilities? generic rebuking
	- holy 
	- dark
	
Ice elementalist profile:

fighting low

spellcasting high as possible
	all rest min...
elementalism high <- could make it an inferred stat. 
	all rest min -> overlap. if theres only two options, the generic skill is redundant.

generic skill experience = [lowest skill xp] * [number of skills]

elementalism: 10
	- fire: 8
	- ice: 12

religion low

Ice elementalist profile:
fighting low
spellcasting maxed -> min improvement

improving a generic skill -> balances existing skills
	-> convenient way to play a 'simpler' game
Care must be taken -> generalists get a free skill, specialists cant ignore bottom line

take 2:

generic skill = (weighted) average skill level
bias generic skills so relatively high skill levels mean more -> but only allow generic == highest for all same stat
This allows a reasonable specialization, while occasionally makes dumping skills to become more generic useful.
Generally it should be geared so a certain skill can reasonably be left at 0. 
Specializing should be very powerful, but give you less 'oomph' from higher level abilities that use many skills at once.
Allows things to rely directly on the generic skill. A fighter shouldn't worry too much about specializing in a religious pursuit.

Eg: Magic flaming holy sword -> takes spellcasting/fire/holy skills into account
