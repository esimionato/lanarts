-- Do everything to make kiting in the overworld a bad idea
    -- Every time you kill something, spawn something just out of view, appropriate for the area the player is in
    -- Spawn fast things.

-- Dont have enemies spawn into vault areas.
-- smaller levels in last dungeon
    -- Maybe?
--- Knockback maul: Hits enemies back on hit
-- Never go bare fisted if have weapon!!
    - Go weapon if unequip arrows
    - mp/hp regen rings unpowered -- add buff + diff bonuses?

RANDART PROPERTIES:
    + attack vs clouds
    + regen while resting
    + speed while damaged
    + berserk duration

TODO:
    + spell where mage walks through enemies OBSOLETE?
    + Dance pants: Cursed, +1 speed, random walk on hit
    + Archer totem -- place totem, starting firing quickly towards it
    + Mage bomb -- place bomb, it explodes
    + within_bounds() failure on ogre mage area when going back up the stairs
    -- scale overworld to # players
    + send sync data for all objects in view by all players every frame
        + have players send their set of objects in view, if ever objects are communicated that dont exist, do level-wide sync
        + have different sync levels.
            sync level 1:
                no object communcation beyond player positions, level-wide sync if player positions dont match
            sync level 2:
                communicate object positions for any objects in view by any players on any persons copy, level-wide sync if mismatch
                -- Also communicate character health?
            sync level 3:
                communicate full data about any objects in view? level-wide sync on level enter?
    + have network communication during level loading?
        + Tricky AF, easiest to serialize any finalized levels.
        + Just have server generate all levels and lazily send? Long-term.
    + Lazy CSP?
        + Have server play normally, have clients play out of sync, use sync level 3
        + With a separated server, this could work!
            +Major problem tho is newly created instances. Need to have a translation layer to accomodate these instances somehow? Significant complexity.
