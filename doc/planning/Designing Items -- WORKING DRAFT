Designing items to be used in Lanarts is, like all Lanarts scripting, a matter of writing Lua code.

For now we will focus on creating a one-time use item. The basic call we have to use is 'data.item_create'.

Lets start with a minimal working example.

Create a file in the Lanarts res/ folder called my_items.lua (or whatever you want to name it)

Inside place this:

    data.item_create  {
        type = items.CONSUMABLE,
        name = "The Item",
        sprite = data.sprite "my_item.png", 
        on_use = function(self, user)
            show_message("We used it!")
        end
    }

'on_use' defines the behaviour of the item when it is used. Since this is a consumable item, it provides a single use, and then dissapears.
'self' in this function refers to the item, and can be used to look-up the item's properties. 'user' in this function refers to the enemy or player using this item.
Note though that enemy's will not know how to use items right off the bat.
For ways simple item behaviour can be implemented, see other items as examples, as well as the general Lanarts API.
Items that cause temporary effects are a bit harder, and will be discussed in part 2, state hooks.

Now, in the game, we need to make sure it is loaded. Go into res/main.lua:

In the function engine.resources_load, add the following line:

    dofile "res/my_items.lua"

Now, start up a game. When your game has started (ie, you have picked your character and are actually playing), press enter, and type the following:

    !item The Item

You should get the message:

    We used it!

Valid item types currently include:
    items.CONSUMABLE, items.POTION, items.SCROLL, items.WEAPON, items.BODY_ARMOUR, items.BOOTS, items.GLOVES, items.HEADGEAR

Samples for wieldable items are given in part 2.
