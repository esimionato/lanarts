weapon migration plan:
 - for now, keep 
    damage: {base: [2,5], strength: 0.75} 
   format. Delay ALL changes to stat overhaul. Focus on more event functionality with exact refactoring -- anything else is a mess waiting to happen.
		-- Plus delaying stat changes allows for a new release without much risk of breakage

  - name: Magic Sword
    shop_cost: [75,95]

    resist_modifier: 1.1
    power: {base: 1, strength: 0.2}

    on_hit_func: use_magic_sword

    spr_item: magic sword


data.weapon_create vs data.item_create
To the layperson, they aren't necessarily the same thing
Clean separation is better, the consistency is false.
It is possible (and recommended) that custom reosurces types be added to the 'data' namespace.
Should it be Data? -- Action item, change all major lua namespaces to capitals

Data.weapon_create {
	name = "Magic Sword",
	description = "An enchanted sword that saps your mana reserves, but does greater damage.",
	weapon_class = "short blades", -- eventually change this to 'type' ? but this is OK
	shop_cost = [75, 95],
    	damage = { base = {4,8}, strength = 1.1, magic = 0.2},
    	resist_modifier = 1.1,
    	power = {base = 1, strength = 0.2},
   	range = 7
}

drawing stats -> can be done automatically if table provided, but otherwise ??
Can be hard to draw all the details, maybe provide a 'more...' button with full stat listing.
-> This will pause the game in single-player, draw in the middle of the screen w/ transparency.
OK.
